### Writeup 
In cryptography, there are many different types of ciphers, such as RSA, ROT, and Base64. The question mentions `ROT13`. ROT13 is a type of **Caesar Cipher**, a cipher which shifts each letter up a certain amount. We call this number the **shift**.

A quick example is this: If I had the letter `E`, and the shift is `3`, the encrypted ciphertext is `H`.  E -> (1) F -> (2) G -> (3) **H**.

ROT13 is a special example of Caesar Cipher where the shift is 13. Now, you need a decoder to decode it (or undergo a lot of unnecessary work.) I used https://rot13.com, but you can use any other decoder which would also work.

After plugging the wrapped part of the description (`cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}`)  into the encoding section of the top box, you should get our flag, wrapped in `picoCTF{...}` in the bottom box:

```
picoCTF{not_too_bad_of_a_problem}
