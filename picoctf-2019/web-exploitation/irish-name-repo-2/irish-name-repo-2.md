### Writeup 
When trying the method used in the [Irish-Name-Repo 1](../irish-name-repo-1/irish-name-repo-1.md), the website states "SQLi detected." However, another form of SQL injection is to select a specific user. Setting the username field to `admin';--` would set the username to `admin`, close the string, and comment out the remainder of the statement, circumventing the password check. This yields: `picoCTF{m0R3_SQL_plz_fa983901}`.
