### Writeup 
There are many different ways to **encrypt** a message, and this is what we call **ciphers**.  There are many common ones, such as Base64, Caesar, and Morse code. ROT13 is a special type of symmetric cipher where decoding and encoding are the same thing. Use an online decoder, such as [this one](rot13.com), and type into the white box the wrapped text and this should be in the bottom text.

picoCTF{not_too_bad_of_a_problem}
```
As such, we have our flag, wrapped in `picoCTF{...}`
